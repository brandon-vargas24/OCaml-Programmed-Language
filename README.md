# OCaml-Programmed-Language
This Programming Language called Mercury is a trivial pedagogical "programming" language featuring 
only integer expressions with binary operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and '%'.
The operators are all left-associative and with the usual precedence. Evaluation is straightforward with 
one important property: Mercury traps **division by zero** errors.
